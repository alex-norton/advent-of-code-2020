Complete, compilable, runnable solutions for Advent of Code 2020 in Rust, along with my input data.

This was the first thing I ever wrote in Rust, and was written over a lazy month with many peaks and valleys in motivation.
It's not supposed to be efficient and it's not supposed to be read by anyone but me. Please don't judge it too hard!

That said, happy to answer questions about it, and to happy to receive any feedback on Rust idioms.
